# CNT-Potential-Function
This repository contains the code and the data used for generating the potential function for carbon nanotubes.

The "CNT.ipynb" file contains the code the graphical results of the simulation.

The "CNT Potential Function Report" is a short description of the methodology and the results.

The data to be used for the simulation is provided as the rest of the CSV files.
